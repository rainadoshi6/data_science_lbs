# Introduction and BBC iPlayer streaming data

<div class = "navy1">

The BBC is one of the oldest broadcasting organisations of the world. As a public service, its aim is to inform, educate, and entertain the UK population. Due to this broad mission, its key performance measures are not associated with financial profit but instead with how well it manages to engage the wider public with its program offering. To achieve its mission, it is particularly important to know which customer segments are interested in what content and how this drives their engagement with the BBC (often measured by how happy they are to pay for the TV licensing fees).

Traditionally, the BBC reached its audience through terrestrial broadcasting, first analogue and then digital, which made it difficult to monitor public engagement. This had to been done retrospectively by monitoring a relatively small sample of representative consumers who consented to having their TV-watching habits observed and recorded. More recently, the BBC launched a digital TV streaming service, the BBC iPlayer, which allows streaming BBC content on demand. Besides being a more convenient way to deliver content to the public, the streaming service allows the BBC to get a more detailed perspective of public engagement. In time, this should allow the BBC to better predict how different customer segments react to the programs it offers and become more effective in informing, educating, and entertaining them. 


The goal of this workshop is to use data mining techniques to gain a data-based view of BBC’s iPlayer customers and the content it provides.  

i) In the first step we will process the raw data for analysis. We need to clean and enrich the data. I have already completed this step and this will not be the focus of this workshop. 

ii)  We have an engagement based data and in the second step we will convert this to a user based data. Also we will engineer new features. The instructions for this step are provided in this RMarkdown file. Some of the code for these steps are provided and you are expected to complete the rest. (Expected time for completion: 45 minutes).

iii) In the third step you will create meaningful customer segments for the users of the BBC iPlayer. In this step you will use K-Means, K-Medoid and H-Clustering methods to determine meaningful clusters for iPlayer viewers. The instructions for this step is provided in this RMarkdown file as well.

The original data file contains information extracted from the BBC iPlayer database. The dataset was created by choosing approximately 10000 random viewers who watched something on iPlayer in January and then recording their viewing behaviour until the end of April. This means that customers who did not watch in January will not be in the dataset. Every row represents a viewing event. Given the way the data was created, during January the data is representative of what is watched on the iPlayer. After January the data is no longer representative as it is no longer a random sample of the people watching iPlayer content.

## How to get the most out of this exercise

<div class = "navy1">

First read the learning outcomes, which provides a list of things you should be doing in this exercise.

Although this is a group exercise, I reccomend you complete each step on your own before you confer with your teammates. The instructions and questions are designed to make you think about clustering beyond this specific example. Therefore, by going through these steps on your own, you will be able to meet the learning objectives I stated above.

One way of achieveing this would be setting a milestone for every step below. When all the group members achieve this milestone you can discuss what you find with your group mates.

I do not reccomend a division of labour among group members; as this will significantly reduce your learning from this exercise. 
</div>

# Cleaned Data

I have already processed and cleaned the original view data. In this step you will first generate a user-based database which we will use to train clustering algorithms to identify meaningful clusters in the data.

Let's load the cleaned data and investigate what's in the data. See below for column descriptions.

```{r Load data}
cleaned_BBC_Data <- read_csv(file="Results_Step1.csv",col_names = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
glimpse(cleaned_BBC_Data) 
```

<div class = "navy">
The column descriptions are as follows.

a)	user_id  -- a unique identifier for the viewer

b)	program_id and series_id -- these identify the program and the series that the program belongs to

c)	genre -- the programme’s genre (e.g., drama, factual, news, sport, comedy, etc)

d)	start_date_time -- the streaming start date/time of the event

e)	Streaming id -- a unique identifier per streaming event

f)	prog_duration_min -- the program duration in minutes

g)	time_viewed_min -- how long the customer watched the program in minutes

h)  duration_more_30s - equals 1 if the program duration is more than 30 seconds, equals 0 otherwise 

h)  time_viewed_more_5s - equals 1 if time_viewed is more than 5 seconds, equals 0 otherwise

i)  percentage_program_viewed -- percantage of the program viewed

j) watched_more_60_percent -- equals 1 if more than 60% of the program is watched, equals 0 otherwise

k) month, day, hour, weekend -- timing of the viewing

l) time_of_day -- equals “Night” if the viewing occurs between 22 and 6am, "Day" if it occurs between 6AM and 14, “Afternoon” if the it occurs between 14 and 17, “Evening” otherwise
</div>

Before we proceed let's consider the usage in January only.

```{r filter data}
cleaned_BBC_Data<-filter(cleaned_BBC_Data,month==1)
```



# User based data

We will try to create meaningful customer segments that describe users of the BBC iPlayer service. First we need to change the data to user based and generate a summary of their usage. 


## Data format


The data is presented to us in an event-based format (every row captures a viewing event). However we need to detect the differences between the general watching habits of users. 

How can you convert the current date set to a customer-based dataset (i.e., summarizes the general watching habits of each user). In what dimensions could BBC iPlayer users be differentiated? Can you come up with variables that capture these? Discuss these issues with your group and determine a strategy on how data must be processed

## Feature Engineering



For the workshop let’s generate the following variables for each user.


i.	Total number of shows watched and ii.	Total time spent watching shows on iPlayer by each user in the data

```{r total number of shows and time }
userData<-cleaned_BBC_Data %>%
  group_by(user_id) %>% 
  summarise(noShows=n(), total_Time=sum(time_viewed_min)) 
```


iii.	Proportion of shows watched during the weekend for each user.

```{r percentage weekend}

#Let's find the number of shows on weekend and weekdays
userData2<-cleaned_BBC_Data %>% group_by(user_id,weekend) %>% summarise(noShows=n())

#Let's find percentage in weekend and weekday
userData3 = userData2%>% group_by(user_id) %>% mutate(weight_pct = noShows / sum(noShows))

#Let's create a data frame with each user in a row.
userData3<-select (userData3,-noShows)
userData3<-userData3%>% spread(weekend,weight_pct,fill=0) %>%as.data.frame()
#Let's merge the final result with the data frame from the previous step.
userdatall<-left_join(userData,userData3,by="user_id")
```

iv.	Proportion of shows watched during different times of day for each user.

```{r percentage time of day}

#Code in this block follows the same steps above.
userData2<-cleaned_BBC_Data %>%
  group_by(user_id,time_of_day) %>% 
  summarise(noShows=n()) %>%
  mutate(weight_pct = noShows / sum(noShows))

userData4<-select (userData2,-c(noShows))
userData4<-spread(userData4,time_of_day,weight_pct,fill=0)

userdatall<-left_join(userdatall,userData4,by="user_id")
```

> Question 1.	Find the proportion of shows watched in each genre by each user. Your code below.

```{r percentage by genre}
userdatall <- cleaned_BBC_Data %>%
  group_by(user_id,genre) %>%
  summarise(noShows=n()) %>% 
  mutate(weight_pct = noShows / sum(noShows)) %>% 
  select(-c(noShows)) %>% 
  spread(genre, weight_pct, fill=0) %>% 
  left_join(userdatall, ., by="user_id")

```


> Question 2. Add one more variable of your own. Describe why this might be useful for differentating viewers in 1 or 2 lines. Your code below.

```{r add one more variable}
# Some people just randomly watch pieces of programs rather than watch the whole program.
# the median percentage of a program the user would watch. and std of it.
# We get some NA's for the standard deviation column because some customers have only one instance a viewing
userdatall<-cleaned_BBC_Data %>%
  mutate(program_viewed_percentage = time_viewed_min/prog_duration_min) %>% 
  group_by(user_id) %>% 
  summarise(median_viewed_percentage = median(program_viewed_percentage),
            sd_viewed_percentage = sd(program_viewed_percentage)) %>% 
  left_join(userdatall, ., by='user_id')

```

# Visualizing user-based data
Next visualize the information captured in the user based data. Let's start with the correlations.

```{r correlations, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library("GGally")
userdatall %>% 
  select(-user_id) %>% #keep Y variable last
  ggcorr(method = c("pairwise", "pearson"), layout.exp = 3,label_round=2, label = TRUE,label_size = 2,hjust = 1)

```

> Question 3. Which variables are most correlated? What's the implication of this for clustering?

The variables total watching time and number of shows watched are highly correlated. It may indicate one of them are redundant in clustering analysis. Those users who watch more shows are tend to watch longer.

> Question 4. Investigate the distribution of noShows and total_Time using box-whisker plots and histograms. Explain what you observe in 1-2 sentences. Are you worried about outliers?

< to answer > I would like to keep those outliers because they represent a certain kind of users in reality.

```{r}
g1 <- userdatall %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log(total_Time)))+
  geom_boxplot()

g2 <- userdatall %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=total_Time))+
  geom_histogram()
  
g3 <- userdatall %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log(noShows)))+
  geom_boxplot()
  
g4 <- userdatall %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log(noShows)))+
  geom_histogram()

(g1+g2)/(g3+g4)
```

## Delete infrequent users

Delete the records for users whose total view time is less than 5 minutes and who views 5 or fewer programs. These users are not very likely to be informative for clustering purposes. Or we can view these users as a 'low-engagement' cluster. 


```{r delete}
userdata_red <- userdatall %>%
  filter(total_Time>=5) %>%
  filter(noShows>=5)
ggplot(userdata_red, aes(x=total_Time))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=25)+
  labs(x="Total Time Watched (mins)", y= "Count")
```


# Clustering with K-Means

Now we are ready to find clusters in the BBC iPlayer viewers. We will start with the K-Means algorithm.

## Training a K-Means Model

Train a K-Means model. Start with 2 clusters and make sure you de-select `user_id` variable. Also don’t forget to scale the data. Use 50 random starts. Should we use more starts?

Also display the cluster sizes. See the RMarkdown file from the last session to identify the R functions you need for this and the tasks below.

Use `summary("kmeans Object")` to examine the components of the results of the clustering algorithm. How many points are in each cluster?

```{r fit kmean k2}

set.seed(1234)

k=2
# Get rid of variables that you might not need. Do not include no shows as well because it is highly correlated with total time
clusters_bbc_data <- userdata_red %>% 
  mutate(log_total_time = log(total_Time)) %>%#log transform total time to reduce the impact of outliers 
  select(-c(user_id,noShows,total_Time)) %>% 
  scale()
clusters_bbc <- clusters_bbc_data %>% #scale the data
  eclust(x=., FUNcluster = "kmeans", k = k, nstart = 50, graph = FALSE) #train kmeans clustering

#add clusters to the data frame
userdata_red$cluster <- clusters_bbc$cluster

# size of clusters
clusters_bbc$size

```


## Visualizing the results

### Cluster centers 

Plot the normalized cluster centers. Try to describe the clusters that the algorithm suggests. 

```{r cluster centers}
cluster_centers <- data.frame(cluster=as.factor(c(1:2)),
                              clusters_bbc$centers)

#transpose this data frame
cluster_centers_t <- cluster_centers %>% 
  gather(variable,value,-cluster,factor_key = TRUE)

#plot the centers
ggplot(cluster_centers_t, aes(x = variable, y = value))+
  geom_line(aes(color =cluster,group = cluster), linetype = "dashed",size=1)+
  geom_point(size=1,shape=4)+geom_hline(yintercept=0)+
  theme(text = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1),)+
  ggtitle("K-means Centers k=2")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set4")
```

Can you interpret each cluster from this plot? Did you arrive at meaningful clusters?

< to answer > 

> Cluster 1 like to watch on weekends daytime and Cluster 2 like to watch on weekdays evening. For the weekends watchers, the genres they are interested in are likely to be Entertainment, Music and Sports. For the other cluster of watchers, they like to watch Drama, Factual and Weather programmes, and they generally spend more time on TV and are more likely to finish the whole programme.

How can you use the cluster information to improve the viewer experience with BBC iPlayer? We will come back to these points below. However it is important to think about these issues at the beginning.

> With the knowledge above, I would recommend them to schedule corresponding programmes on weekdays and weekends (daytime and evening), and negotiate with ads providers about the lengths and prices for weekday programmes because the audience clearly have more probability to pay attention to the ads while having incentives to finish the programmes. On the other hand, reducing the lengths of ads can probably improve their experiences.

### Clusters vs variables

Plot a scatter plot for the viewers with respect to total_Time and weekend variables with color set to the cluster number of the user. What do you observe? Which variable seems to play a more prominent role in determining the clusters of users?

```{r distribution wrt. variables}
userdata_red %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(total_Time), y = weekend, color = as.factor(cluster))) +
  geom_jitter()+
  labs(color = "Cluster")+
  NULL

```

### Clusters vs PCA components

Repeat the previous step and use the first two principle components using `fviz_cluster` function.

```{r cluster centers 2}
fviz_cluster(clusters_bbc, clusters_bbc_data, palette = "Set2",
             geom = "point",
             ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```

### Clusters vs PCA components without log transform

As a "side exercise", use K-means method again but this time do not log transform `total time` and include `no_shows` as well. Compare your results to the case when you use log transformation. Then visualize the first two principle components using `fviz_cluster` function.

```{r cluster centers without log transform}
userdata_red %>% 
  select(-c(user_id,noShows)) %>% 
  scale() %>% #scale the data
  eclust(x=., FUNcluster = "kmeans", k = 2, nstart = 50, graph = F) %>% #train kmeans clustering
  fviz_cluster(userdata_red, palette = "Set2",
             geom = "point",
             ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```


Do you observe any outliers? 

> Yes, without taking the log of total time and including no_shows, we can see there are a few outliers that are included in cluster 2. 

> Since we are looking for general tendencies, we want to remove the ouliers as PCA is very sensative to outliers. We want to make the points in the cluters as similiar to themselves as possible (low within cluter variance), and the inclusion of the outliers makes this hard to do and can lead to misleading results. 

## Elbow Chart

Produce an elbow chart and identify a reasonable range for the number of clusters. 


```{r elbow}
fviz_nbclust(clusters_bbc_data,
  kmeans,
  k.max = 20,
  method = "wss")+
  labs(subtitle = "Elbow method")
```

## Silhouette method

Repeat the previous step for Silhouette analysis.

```{r Silhouette}

fviz_nbclust(clusters_bbc_data,
             kmeans, method = "silhouette",
             k.max = 20)+
  labs(subtitle = "Silhouette method")
```



> Question 5: Summarize the conclusions of your Elbow Chart and Silhoutte analysis. What range of values for the number of clusters seems more plausible?

> When looking at this elbow chart alone, we get to see what happens when too may data points are in the middle. As one can see, the sum of the square errors is constantly decreasing as we increase number of K clusters so there is no obvious optimal level of K when we look at this elbow chart. Usually, one will see a line that looks like an elbow, with a rapid decrease SSE when one initially increases K, and then one a threshold is reached, the change in SSE diminishes a lot. Here, we can see that at K=17 the SSE stops decreasing as much, and at k=19, it starts to increase. According to this elbow chart, the SSE is the lowest when K = 19, however we need to take into account the meaningfulness of clustering if we have 19 different clusters. 

>	The silhouette analysis shows us how well matched the data points in each cluster are to each other. We would want the mean Silhoutte Score, which is the average similarity within clusters, to be high, as we want to increase the number of clusters as long as the members within each cluster keep in being different. When we go from k=4 to k=5 the SW decreases a significant amount, telling us there there is not as much similarity within the clusters when we have 5 clusters.

> Conclusiong: 4 can be a good number of clusters


## Comparing k-means with different k

>Question 6: For simplicity let's focus on lower values. Now find the clusters using kmeans for k=3, 4 and 5. Plot the centers and check the number of observations in each cluster. Based on these graphs which one seems to be more plausible? Which clusters are observable in each case? Don't forget to check the cluster sizes.


```{r }
#Fit kmeans models
model_km3 <- clusters_bbc_data %>% #scale the data
  eclust(x=., FUNcluster = "kmeans", k = 3, nstart = 50, graph = FALSE)
model_km4 <- clusters_bbc_data %>% #scale the data
  eclust(x=., FUNcluster = "kmeans", k = 4, nstart = 50, graph = FALSE)
model_km5 <- clusters_bbc_data %>% #scale the data

## H-Clustering

Use Hierercahial clustering with the same k you chose above. Set hc_method equal to `average` and then `ward.D`. What differences do you observe between the results of these two methods? Visualize the results using dendrograms. How many points does each cluster have? Plot the centers of the clusters and produce PCA visualization.

```{r h-cluster}
#dist function find the distances between points
res.dist <- dist(clusters_bbc_data, method = "euclidean")
res.hc <- hcut(res.dist, hc_method = "ward.D",k=4)
plot(res.hc,hang = -1, cex = 0.5, labels = FALSE)
```

Plot the centers of H-clusters and compare the results with K-Means and PAM.

Let's look at cluster centers.

```{r cluster centers H-clustering, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=10}
#First let's find the averages of the variables by cluster
clusters_bbc_data_hc<-mutate(data.frame(clusters_bbc_data), 
                                   cluster = as.factor(res.hc$cluster))

center_locations <- clusters_bbc_data_hc %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  summarize_at(vars(weekday:log_total_time),mean)

#Next I use gather to collect information together
xa2<- gather(center_locations, key = "variable", value = "value",-cluster,factor_key = TRUE)

#Next I use ggplot to visualize centers
hclust_center<-ggplot(xa2, aes(x = variable, y = value,order=cluster))+
  geom_line(aes(color = cluster,group = cluster), linetype = "dashed",size=1)+
  geom_point(size=2,shape=4)+
  geom_hline(yintercept=0)+
  ggtitle("H-clust K=3")+
  labs(fill = "Cluster")+

```{r}
p4 <- fviz_cluster(model_km4, geom = "point",  data = clusters_bbc_data) + ggtitle("Kmeans, k = 4")
p4_hc <- fviz_cluster(res.hc, geom = "point",  data = clusters_bbc_data) + ggtitle("H-Clustering, k = 4")
(p4+p4_hc)

s4_hc <- fviz_silhouette(res.hc) + ggtitle(paste("H-Clustering, k = 4", "avg sw=",
                format(round(res.hc$silinfo$avg.width,3))))

>Question 7: Based on the results of these three methods, what can you conclude?

# Subsample check

At this stage you must have chosen the number of clusters. We will try to reinforce your conclusions and verify that they are not due to chance by dividing the data into two equal parts. Use K-means clustering, fixing the number of clusters to your choice, in these two data sets separately. If you get similar looking clusters, you can rest assured that you conclusions are robust. If not you might want to reconsider your decision.

```{r out of sample check}
library(rsample)
#the following code chunk splits the data into two. Replace ... with your data frame that contains the data
set.seed(1234)
train_test_split <- initial_split(data.frame(clusters_bbc_data), prop = 0.5)
testing <- testing(train_test_split) #50% of the data is set aside for testing
training <- training(train_test_split) #50% of the data is set aside for training

#Fit k-means to each dataset and compare your results
model_km4_train <- training %>% #scale the data
  eclust(x=., FUNcluster = "kmeans", k = 4, nstart = 50, graph = FALSE)

model_km4_test <-testing %>% #scale the data
  eclust(x=., FUNcluster = "kmeans", k = 4, nstart = 50, graph = FALSE)

p_train <- fviz_cluster(model_km4_train, geom = "point",  data = clusters_bbc_data) + ggtitle("k = 4 train")
p_test <- fviz_cluster(model_km4_test, geom = "point",  data = clusters_bbc_data) + ggtitle("k = 4 test")

p_train + p_test



cluster_centers_train <- data.frame(cluster=as.factor(c(1:4)),
                              model_km4_train$centers)

cluster_centers_test <- data.frame(cluster=as.factor(c(1:4)),
                              model_km4_test$centers)

#transpose this data frame
cluster_centers_train_transpose <- cluster_centers_train %>% 
  gather(variable,value,-cluster,factor_key = TRUE)

cluster_centers_test_transpose <- cluster_centers_test %>% 
  gather(variable,value,-cluster,factor_key = TRUE)

#plot the centers
graph_cluster_centers_train <- ggplot(cluster_centers_train_transpose, aes(x = variable, y = value))+
  geom_line(aes(color =cluster,group = cluster), linetype = "dashed",size=1)+
  geom_point(size=1,shape=4)+geom_hline(yintercept=0)+
  theme(text = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1),)+
  ggtitle("K-means Centers k=4 train")

graph_cluster_centers_test<- ggplot(cluster_centers_test_transpose, aes(x = variable, y = value))+

        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1),)+
  ggtitle("K-means Centers k=4 test")

train_silhouette<-fviz_silhouette(model_km4_train)+
  ggtitle(paste("k = 4 train", "avg sw=",
                format(round(model_km4_train$silinfo$avg.width,3))))
test_silhouette<-fviz_silhouette(model_km4_test)+
  ggtitle(paste("k = 4 test", "avg sw=",
                format(round(model_km4_test$silinfo$avg.width,3))))

train_silhouette+test_silhouette

```


>Question 8: Based on the results, what can you conclude? Are you more or less confident in your results?

We got similar results for training and testing data. 

Then we show the clusters in each set with their features (the variables they have the highest value with).

Training set:
- cluster 1: Weekend Entertainment, Sports (cluster 2 in testing data)
- cluster 2: Day, Weekday, News, Factual and Weather (cluster 3 in testing data) (Maybe old peole)
- cluster 3: Evening, Drama (cluster 1 in testing data)
- cluster 4: Afternoon, Children and Learning

The PCA and Silhouette visualizations are also very similar. So we are more confident with the clustering results.

# Conclusions

>Question 9: In plain English, explain which clusters you can confidently conclude that exist in the data, based on all your analysis in this exercise.

>Do you think you chose the right `k`? Explain you reasoning.

Based on Silhouette method, the score becomes worse when increase k from 4 to 5. In addition, we can get insightful conclusions based on k=4. Although with k=19 the silhouette score is the lowest, the explainablity will be worse with too many clusters. We believe k=4 is a right number of clusters

>What assumptions do you think your results are sensitive to? How can you check the robustness of your conclusions? Just explain, you don't have to carry out the analysis.

Based on the clustering model with historical data, We assume users will behave in the same way as before. We can check the robustness by splitting the data based on time and testing the performance of models.


>Finally explain how the information about these clusters can be used to improve viewer experience for BBC or other online video streaming services.

BBC can schedule and create more the TV programmes in different genres in corresponding time slots in a day of the clusters. Ex: more sports related content on the weekend for cluster 1.

And they can also do more marketing campaigns targeting on different groups of customers based on the clustering results.
